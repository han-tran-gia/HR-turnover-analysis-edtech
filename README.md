# HR Turnover & Hiring Analysis (EdTech)
## Problem Statement
This project analyzes the HR landscape of an EdTech company, focusing on employee turnover and hiring efficiency. The company faced critical workforce instability, with a 39.5% annual turnover rate, primarily driven by employees with less than two years of tenure. Attrition was most severe in revenue-generating and operational roles, posing significant risks to business continuity, productivity, and revenue growth.


## Approach
I assessed workforce stability by analyzing overall and tenure-based turnover to identify the most affected employee segments and key attrition drivers. I then evaluated hiring effectiveness across major branches and job levels, comparing new hires, rehires, and internal transfers to determine whether recruitment efforts adequately offset attrition.

## Key Insights
80% of resignations came from employees with < 2 years of experience, indicating weak onboarding and early retention.
88% of exits were voluntary, signaling structural retention issues rather than labor supply problems.
Revenue and execution roles had the highest attrition but lowest replacement rates.
63% of vacancies were filled via internal transfers, spreading instability across departments.
Replacing one senior leader required 2–3 new hires, significantly reducing operational efficiency.
